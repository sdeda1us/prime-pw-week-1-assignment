    <blockquote cite="https://www.amazon.com/Between-Past-Future-Penguin-Classics/dp/0143104810">"Objectively, that is, seen from the outside and without taking into account that man is a beginning and a beginner, the chances that tomorrow will be like yesterday are always overwhelming. Not quite so overwhelming, to be sure, but very nearly so as the chances were that <em>no</em> earth would ever rise out of  cosmic occurences, that <em>no</em> life would develop out of inorganic processes, and that <em>no</em> man would emerge out of the evolution of animal life. The decisive difference between the 'infinite improbabilities' on which the reality of our earthly life rests and the miraculous character inherent in those events which established historical reality is that, in the realm of human affairs, we know the auhtor of the 'miralces.' It is men who perform them&mdash;men who because they have recieved the twofold gift of freedom and action can establish a reality of their own."</blockquote>
